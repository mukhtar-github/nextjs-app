> _“Train your mind to see the good in everything. Being positive is a choice. The happiness of you life depends on the quality of your thoughts.” — Dr. Bilal Philips_

When I realized the dialogue within my inner self can either make me or destroy me, then I started sorting out the thoughts I conceived and processed.

> _“What you focus on most of the time gets bigger and dominates your thinking and your life.”_

With the high expectation that I’ve passed all the exams, I wrote for successful graduation, only to receive a call from my PG School that I have a course to resit. Overwhelmed with sadness, frustration, and depression, I decided to throw in the towel.

Although, life is generally a battleground, filled with struggles to achieve set goals. There are stages you’d think you are done with, only to realize that you’ve been trapped in it. Huh!

## Success Starts in The Mind

> _“If you want to be successful in any area, train your mind to look beyond obstacles, disappointments, setbacks, and even failures. A success life starts with a successful attitude.” — Muyiwa Afolabi_

In one of his articles, [Frankly Speaking](http://www.muyiwaafolabi.com/blog/), Muyiwa Afolabi described solution thinking as the first right step out of any crises. Don’t make the unusual environment your excuse. Overcome the unusual environment with unusual superior answers. Take charge of your life.

> _“Life is about out comes and results. No one can doubt a wonderful and outstanding result, performance or outcome”_

And that’s how I figured it out, sat my ass down, read very well for the final exam and came out with — A grade.

It wasn’t magic, it’s because I took control of the situation through refining my thinking on the problem.

## Happiness Comes from Within

> _“Happiness is not only how we can astound our senses, but also the peace of mind that comes from knowing we are becoming
who we want and need to be.” — Brianna Wiest_

In her article [The Happiness of Excellence](https://medium.com/@briaeliza/the-happiness-of-excellence-e7e72193490), Brianna Wiest described the three types of Happiness by Eric Greitens: the happiness of pleasure which is largely sensory and the source of greed, the happiness of grace which is in the form of gratitude for the blessings bestowed on you.

Then, the happiness of excellence that comes from the pursuit of something great in life. The result isn’t immediate, so it’s mostly avoided since it takes you out of your comfort zone.

A successful life is attained through harnessing the _Happiness of excellence._

> _“Never through history has a man who lived a life of ease left a name worth remembering.” — Theodore Roosevelt_

## Change The Way You Think

> _“Excellence is never an accident. It is always the result of high intention, sincere effort, and intelligent execution; it represents the wise choice of many alternatives. Choice not chance, determines your destiny.” — Aristotle_

Thinking leads to how we imagine things. The imagination results in how we feel about things. And our feelings direct us to take action.

The action may be good as a result of positive energy produced by positive thinking. Or it may be bad as a result of negative energy produced by negative thinking as well.

Feelings are emotionally stronger than willpower. Therefore, our feelings control the way we behave and act.

Because of the way we think has an impact on our feelings. We should control what goes into our minds for processing.
